globs: src/**/*.tsx

- Ensure all components are reusable and follow the existing design patterns.
- Ensure all components are responsive and accessible.
- Do not export default
- All files should be Kabob Case and the function name should be the same but in Pascal Case
- Prefer types over interfaces
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling, adhering to the defined color palette.
- Page routes should be in the /src/app folder but they should just contain basic page loading details. The primary container should be in /src/views
- Private Components: For components used only within specific pages, you can create a /components folder within the relevant /view subdirectory.
- Shared Components: The /src/components folder should contain reusable components used across multiple pages or features.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
